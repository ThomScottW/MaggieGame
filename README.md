# MaggieGame

This is a re-make of the old SEGA game Columns, made using the third-party python library pygame.

To install this, download the entire directory, navigate to the MaggieColumnsView.py module, and run it.
Ensure that the Virtual Environment interpreter is selected so that pygame is accessible.
