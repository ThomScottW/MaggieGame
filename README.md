# MaggieGame

This is a re-make of the old SEGA game Columns, made using the third-party python library pygame.

# How to Install

1. Download all the files as a zip folder.
2. Extract the MaggieColumns-Master folder.
3. Navigate into the MaggieColumns-Master folder, or open it in an IDE. (I used VS Code).
4. Create a new folder within the MaggieColumns-Master folder for the virtual environment. (I named it "venv".)
5. Create a virtual environment using #python -m venv .
